<div class="method">
	<p>Measure the uncooked rice into a big bowl, then wash it thouroughly and drain. Repeat until the water runs clear, about 5 times.</p>
	<p>After the last drain, add the rice to a pan, then add the water (about 1.5 cups per cup rice). Cover with a lid, then bring to a rolling boil over high heat. As soon as it is boiling, turn the heat to a minimum and leave it on the hot stove for 20 minutes.</p>
	<p>In the meantime, prepare the sushi vinegar by mixing vinegar, salt and sugar and heating it up, then whisking it until everything is dissolved.</p>
	<p>As soon as the rice is done, spread it out on a baking tray and season it with the vinegar. Spread the vinegar by turning the rice gently with a wooden spoon. Cool the rice down by fanning it or use a blow-drier on a cold setting until the rice has reached room temparature.</p>
	<p>Cut the avocado and chicken breast into small strips, julienne the carrot and cucumber, and chop the lettuce leaves.</p>
	<p>For hoso-maki rolls, half the nori sheets. Add a pinch of wasabi to the nori, wet your hands and spread enough rice on it to cover the nori except for the last 1/2 centimeter, then add the fillings. Wet the last bit of the sushi roll with a bit of water and roll with a sushi-mat.</p>
	<p>Ura-Maki are made by covering the whole of a halved nori sheet, then turning it around so the nori is up and putting the fillings directly on the nori. Roll it, then roll it in some black and white sesame seeds.</p>
	<p>If doing futo-maki use a whole nori sheet, cover it with rice except for the last bit, then add multiple fillings and roll as usual.</p> 
	<p>For nigiri, press a bit of rice into a small roll in your hand, then add a slice of fish or other filling on top.</p>
