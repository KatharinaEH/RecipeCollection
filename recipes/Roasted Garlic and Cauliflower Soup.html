<div class="ingredients">
	<ul>
		<li>1 head cauliflower</li>
		<li>3-4 heads garlic</li>

	</ul>

<div class="method">
	<p>Preheat the oven to 200°C. Peel off the outer layers of the garlic bulb, but leave to individual cloves intact and connected. Cut off the very top of the bulb, place it on a square of aluminum foil and coat each with ½ teaspoon of olive oil. Place in heated oven for 35 minutes.</p>
	<p>Once complete, allow to cool slightly before removing from aluminum foil and squeezing out the garlic from each clove.</p>
	<p>Meanwhile, chop the shallots and cut the cauliflower into florets. Pour remaining olive oil in a medium-sized saucepan and add the shallots. Saute until tender and beginning to brown on medium heat, about 6 minutes.</p>
	<p>Add roasted garlic along with remaining ingredients to the saucepan. Cover and bring to a boil, reduce heat to low and simmer for 15-20 minutes until the cauliflower is softened.</p>
	<p>Blend the soup with an immersion blender until smooth. Adjust with salt and pepper and serve.</p>
