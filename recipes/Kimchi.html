<div class="ingredients">
	<ul>
		<li>2 heads of chinese leaf</li>
		<li>1/2 cup salt (free of iodin and anti-caking agent)</li>
		<li>water</li>
		<li>5-6 cloves garlic, grated</li>
		<li>2 teaspoons ginger, grated</li>
		<li>2 teaspoons sugar</li>
		<li>2 tablespoons fish sauce</li>
		<li>7 tablespoons gochugaru (Korean red pepper flakes)</li>
		<li>500 grams daikon</li>
		<li>4 spring onions, chopped</li>
	</ul>

<div class="method">
	<p>Cut the cabbage lengthwise into quarters and remove the cores. Cut each quarter crosswise into 3-cm-wide strips.</p>
	<p>Place the cabbage and salt in a large bowl. Massage the salt into the cabbage until it starts to soften a bit, then add water to cover the cabbage. Weigh it down with something heavy and let stand for 1 to 2 hours.</p>
	<p>Rinse the cabbage under cold water 3 times and drain in a colander for 15 to 20 minutes.</p>
	<p>Meanwhile, combine the garlic, ginger, sugar, gochugaru and fish sauce and mix to form a smooth paste.</p>
	<p>Gently squeeze any remaining water from the cabbage and return it to the bowl along with the radish, spring onions, and seasoning paste.</p>
	<p>Work the paste into the vegetables until they are thoroughly coated.</p>
	<p>Pack the kimchi into the jar, pressing down on it until the brine rises to cover the vegetables. Leave at least 1 inch of headspace. Seal the jar with the lid.</p>
	<p>Let the jar stand at room temperature for 1 to 5 days. You may see bubbles inside the jar and brine may seep out of the lid; place a bowl or plate under the jar to help catch any overflow.</p>
	<p>Check the kimchi once a day, pressing down on the vegetables with a clean finger or spoon to keep them submerged under the brine. Taste a little at this point. When the kimchi tastes ripe enough, transfer the jar to the refrigerator. You may eat it right away, but it's best after another week or two.</p>

	<p>Replace the fish suace with 1 teaspoon kelp powder and water or simply water for vegetarian KImchi. Alternative seafood flavouring: salted shrimp paste or oysters.</p>
