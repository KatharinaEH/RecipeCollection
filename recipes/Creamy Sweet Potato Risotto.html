<div class="method">
	<p>Preheat the oven to 180°C.</p>
	<p>Put the rice into a large saucepan with 700ml of water. Pour in the coconut milk and vinegar and add salt. Bring it to the boil and, once it has boiled for a minute or so, reduce the heat to a simmer. Cover and cook for about 45 minutes, until the rice has cooked and all the liquid has been absorbed.</p>
	<p>Meanwhile, chop 3 of the sweet potatoes into bite-sized pieces, place them on a baking tray  with a little of the olive oil, salt, pepper and the cinnamon. Put the tray in the oven and cook for 30 minutes. Just before the end of cooking, add the pine nuts and let them cook for a couple of minutes until they're golden brown.</p>
	<p>At the same time, peel the remaining sweet potato, cut it into small bite-sized pieces and place in a steamer for 15 minutes, unitl really soft.</p>
	<p>Once the steamed sweet potato is cooked, add it to a blender with 3 tablespoons of olive oil, 100ml of water, the vinegar, tahini, sesame oil, nutritional yeast, cumin, lemon juice, garlic, salt and pepper. Blend until a smooth mix forms.</p>
	<p>Once the rice has finished cooking, stir in the blended mixture along with the roasted sweet potato chunks, pine nuts, coriander and spinach. Let this cook together until the spinach has wilted, then serve.</p>
