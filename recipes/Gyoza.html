<div class="method">
	<p>For the dough sift the flour into a large bowl. Add the salt to the hot water to dissolve it, then add the water to the flour little by little, stirring it in between. Use your hands to form a ball, if the flour is still seperated after adding 120ml water, add more by the tablespoon.</p>
	<p>Knead the dough for 10 minutes, until it is smooth. Cut it in half, form each half into a long roll and wrap them. Let them rest for 30 minutes.</p>
	<p>Sprinkle a little potato starch on the work surface and cut each roll into about 12 pieces. Cover the dough with damp kitchen towel to prevent from drying. Roll each piece of dough into a ball, press the ball flat, then, using a rolling pin, roll them out until you can cut out circles with a 8cm cookie cutter. Sprinkle each wrap with potato starch and stack them under a damp towel until further use.</p>
	<p>For the filling, microwave or fry the cabbage leaves for a minute, then chop it into very small pieces. Chop the spring onion and the shiitake, then mix everything with the meat and knead until sticky.</p>
	<p>Place a small amount of filling in the center of a wrapper, wet a finger in cold water and wet the wrapper, to make it sticky, then fold it in half and seal it by pinching it or pleading it toward the center from both sides. Repeat until running out of wrappers or filling.</p>
	<p>Heat a tablespoon of vegetable oil over medium heat, add the gyoza flat side down and cook for 3 minutes, until the bottom side is browned. Without turning, add 1/4 cup of water to pan and cover immediately, steaming the gyoza for another 3 minutes. Remove the lid and let the remaining water evaporate, then add a teaspoon of sesame oil and leave to cook until the gyoza is crispy on the bottom.</p>
	<p>Alternatively steam for 15 minutes or boil for 6 minutes.</p>
